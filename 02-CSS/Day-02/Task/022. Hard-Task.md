## ðŸ”´ **Hard Example: Product Feature Showcase**

**Concept:**
A webpage that displays three product cards side by side (or stacked on small screens), each using:

* Borders and outlines for layers
* Controlled height, width, and spacing
* Smart use of `margin` and `padding`
* Consistent box model rules

**Learning Goals:**
Show full control over spacing, borders, and outlines using only CSS fundamentals.

### ðŸ§© ** Output Example**

<img width="1165" height="712" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c54d07f6-f4c3-4b95-a1bf-172ad24120ad" />

### ðŸ§  **What This Demonstrates**

1. **Box Model Mastery**
   Each `.product-card` carefully uses `margin`, `padding`, `border`, and `outline` â€” showing how they stack visually.

2. **Outline Offset Usage**
   The orange outline adds a glowing frame outside the border, creating depth.

3. **Polished Design**
   Rounded corners, balanced colors, consistent spacing â€” all using only fundamental CSS properties.

### ðŸ§© **Challenge Extension**

If you want to push your interns even further:

* Add a fourth card and ensure it wraps neatly on smaller screens.
* Replace the button with a bordered version using `outline-offset` for hover effects.
* Try giving each card a unique `outline-style` (solid, dashed, dotted).
