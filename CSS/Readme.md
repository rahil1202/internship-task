## ðŸŸ¦ 1. `static` (default)

ðŸ‘‰ **Stickers just stay where you first put them.**
They follow the normal flow of the page.

```css
position: static;
```

ðŸ’¡ You almost never write this, because itâ€™s the default.

---

## ðŸŸ¨ 2. `relative`

ðŸ‘‰ **Sticker can slide a little** from its place.
It still keeps its original spot, but you can nudge it (up, down, left, right).

```css
position: relative; top: 20px; left: 10px;
```

---

## ðŸŸ¥ 3. `absolute`

ðŸ‘‰ **Sticker floats freely** inside the nearest bigger sticker that allows it.
If no parent has `position` set, it uses the whole page as the reference.

```css
position: absolute; bottom: 0; right: 0;
```

---

## ðŸŸ© 4. `fixed`

ðŸ‘‰ **Sticker is glued to the glass of your screen.**
Even if you scroll the paper up and down, the sticker stays put (like a watermark or navbar).

```css
position: fixed; top: 0; right: 0;
```

---

## ðŸŸ§ 5. `sticky`

ðŸ‘‰ **Sticker is normal at first** (like relative),
but when you scroll, it becomes **glued for a while** until its parent ends.

```css
position: sticky; top: 0;
```

# ðŸŽ¨ Visual analogy

* **Static** â†’ toys on the floor where you dropped them.
* **Relative** â†’ toys still on the floor, but you push one a little to the side.
* **Absolute** â†’ toy floating in the air, stuck to the nearest shelf.
* **Fixed** â†’ toy taped to the window, it doesnâ€™t move when you walk around.
* **Sticky** â†’ toy moves with you until it hits a wall, then it sticks there.

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to make a **small HTML playground** with 5 colored boxes, each showing these behaviors, so you can scroll and *see it happen*?
