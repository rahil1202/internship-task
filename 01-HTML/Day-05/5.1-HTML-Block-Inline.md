Every HTML element is either **block-level** or **inline** by default.
That means: when the browser renders it, it decides how it should appear on the page — whether it takes up the whole line or just as much space as its content needs.

---

## 🔲 Block-Level Elements

Block elements **start on a new line** and **take up the full width** available.
They push the next element down, like bricks stacked vertically.

They’re perfect for creating the *structure* of your page — sections, paragraphs, headers, divs, etc.

### Common Block Elements:

```
<div>, <p>, <h1>–<h6>, <header>, <footer>, <section>, <article>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>, <table>, <form>
```

### Example:

```html
<h2>This is a heading (block element)</h2>
<p>This is a paragraph below the heading.</p>
<div>This is a div — it takes the full width of its container.</div>
```

All three elements appear one after another vertically because each block element automatically occupies the whole horizontal line.

## 🔹 Inline Elements

Inline elements, on the other hand, **do not start on a new line.**
They only take up as much width as their content requires. They fit together side by side, like words in a sentence.

### Common Inline Elements:

```
<span>, <a>, <strong>, <em>, <b>, <i>, <u>, <small>, <mark>, <img>
```

### Example:

```html
<p>This is a <strong>bold</strong> word and this is <em>italic</em> — both inline elements.</p>
```

They stay *within* the same paragraph line — the browser doesn’t break them into new lines.

## 🔄 Comparing Block vs Inline

Let’s visualize how they behave:

```html
<!-- Block Elements -->
<div style="background: lightcoral;">Block 1</div>
<div style="background: lightgreen;">Block 2</div>

<!-- Inline Elements -->
<span style="background: gold;">Inline 1</span>
<span style="background: skyblue;">Inline 2</span>
```

**Result:**

* The two `<div>`s stack vertically.
* The two `<span>`s sit next to each other horizontally.

## 🧩 Inline Inside Block — Yes!

You can place inline elements inside a block element (very common).
But block elements *cannot* be nested directly inside inline elements — that’s invalid HTML.

### Example (✅ Correct)

```html
<p>
  My name is <strong>Rahil</strong> and I love <em>web development</em>.
</p>
```

### Example (❌ Incorrect)

```html
<strong>
  <div>This won’t work properly!</div>
</strong>
```

Browsers may still try to render it, but it breaks proper HTML structure.

## 🎨 CSS Makes It Flexible

While elements have default display types, CSS allows you to **change** them.

### Example:

```html
<style>
span {
  display: block; /* behaves like div now */
  background-color: lightblue;
  padding: 10px;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}
div {
  display: inline; /* behaves like span now */
  background-color: pink;
  padding: 5px;
}
</style>

<div>Block turned Inline</div>
<div>Still Inline</div>
<span>Inline turned Block</span>
<span>Another Block Span</span>
```

**CSS `display` property** gives you this power:

* `display: block` → takes full width
* `display: inline` → sits within a line
* `display: inline-block` → inline layout but allows height & width control (very useful!)

## 🔘 Inline-Block — The Best of Both Worlds

`inline-block` acts like inline (sits side-by-side) but lets you set width and height like block elements.

### Example:

```html
<style>
.card {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 150px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: lightgreen;
  margin: 10px;
  text-align: center;
  line-height: 100px;
  border-radius: 8px;
}
</style>

<div class="card">Card 1</div>
<div class="card">Card 2</div>
<div class="card">Card 3</div>
```

They line up horizontally but keep their block-like dimensions — perfect for things like product cards, image grids, and navigation buttons.

| -------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Start on new line          | ✅ Yes                       | ❌ No                                 |
| Takes full width           | ✅ Yes                       | ❌ Only content width                 |
| Can contain block elements | ✅ Yes                       | ❌ No                                 |
