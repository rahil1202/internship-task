**HTML** stands for **HyperText Markup Language**.
It‚Äôs not a programming language ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **markup language** that describes the **structure and meaning of content** on a web page.

Think of it as the blueprint of a building:

* HTML says *what‚Äôs there* ‚Äî paragraphs, images, buttons, links, forms, etc.
* CSS says *how it looks*.
* JavaScript says *what it does*.

When a browser loads a page, it reads your HTML file from top to bottom and creates a **DOM (Document Object Model)** ‚Äî a tree of elements the browser uses to display and interact with your page.

### ‚öôÔ∏è How HTML Works

1. You write an HTML file (usually called `index.html`).
2. The browser parses it line by line.
3. It builds the **DOM Tree** ‚Äî a live representation of the page structure.
4. CSS and JavaScript later interact with this DOM to style or manipulate content.

So every visible element on a webpage ‚Äî from text to video ‚Äî starts as HTML.

### üßæ Latest Version

The latest major version is **HTML5**, standardized by the **WHATWG** (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group).

HTML5 introduced:

* Semantic elements like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<section>`
* Multimedia support (`<video>`, `<audio>`)
* Form enhancements (`<input type="email">`, `<datalist>`)
* `<canvas>` for graphics
* API support (Geolocation, Web Storage, Drag-and-drop)

HTML5 isn't static ‚Äî it's a **living standard**, continuously updated.

### ‚úçÔ∏è How to Write HTML

HTML files are plain text files that end with `.html`.
You can write them using any text editor ‚Äî even Notepad.

Here‚Äôs a minimal example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my very first webpage.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

### üè∑Ô∏è Tags and Elements

**Tags** tell the browser what kind of content something is.
They usually come in **pairs**:

```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```

* `<p>` ‚Üí opening tag
* `</p>` ‚Üí closing tag
* `This is a paragraph.` ‚Üí content
  Together, that‚Äôs an **element**.

Some tags don‚Äôt have closing pairs ‚Äî they‚Äôre **self-closing**:

```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="A photo of the moon" />
<br />
<hr />
```

### üí° Tips for Writing Clean HTML

* Always start with `<!DOCTYPE html>` (tells browser to use HTML5 mode).
* Use proper **indentation** ‚Äî makes structure readable.
* Close all tags properly (even optional ones like `<li>`).
* Use **semantic HTML** ‚Äî prefer `<header>` over `<div class="header">`.
* Add `alt` text for images (for accessibility and SEO).
* Use lowercase for tag and attribute names.
* Don‚Äôt stuff everything in `<div>` ‚Äî divs are for grouping when no semantic tag fits.
* Validate your HTML using [validator.w3.org](https://validator.w3.org/).

HTML is deceptively simple ‚Äî it‚Äôs just text wrapped in tags ‚Äî but it‚Äôs the foundation of everything on the web.
Without it, the browser has no idea what to display.
